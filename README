hbase is a collection of programs that complements sbase and ubase. It's meant
to be a temporary project that will shrink and die once sbase and ubase gets
implementations of most of the programs included. hbase mostly contains
programs taken from the Heirloom project, but also has other programs, such as
patch taken from FreeBSD and mk taken from plan9port.

Currently it's only been tested with building against a musl toolchain,
building with glibc will not work without some hacking (probably will work if
linked against libbsd, but hasn't been tested).
